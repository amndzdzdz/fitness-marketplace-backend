# fitness-marketplace-backend

This repo contains the code for my fitness marketplace app called trainr. The app allows users that want to workout find suitable trainers. The app offers specifically:

- Users can do two things: Find trainers that appear as wildcards in their feed, or become trainers and provide their services.
- Users can create workout-plans that are saved and can be used similar to strong.
- Users can add their weight
- Users can track their food
- Trainers have access to the users workout-plans, weight and food and can make adjustments.
- Users and trainers can chat.
- Trainers have access to the total user-history and can see the big picture to make future adjustments accordingly

## The main goal is to combine multiple things that a trainer provides into a unified website.

- NO excel spreadsheets -> users receive their workout plans in the app
- NO whatsapp/telegram chats -> users can talk to their trainers directly in the app
- NO word documents with food plans -> trainers plan the diet of their clients directly in the app.
- NO youtube videos with techniques -> trainers upload technique videos and users upload their self recorded technique videos to receive feedback by their trainers.

## Through this app:

- Users have an easy all-in-one solution
- Trainers dont need to juggle multiple plattforms and can focus on their clients.

## Proof of concept

This is a big project, so I want to break it down into a proof of concept that I can create within shorter time! It should have at least the following aspects:

- Users can register +
- Users can login +
- Users can edit their account details +
- Users can create a trainer account (permanent) +
- User can input their weight daily
- Users can create a workout template
- Users can select the workout template and input their stats
- Users and trainers can chat
