# Fitness Marketplace

Fitness Marketplace is a personal project I started because of my love for fitness and technology.  
Itâ€™s a web application where users can track their gym progress, monitor their weight, and eventually connect with trainers to improve their workouts.

This repository has the backend built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB (via Mongoose).  
A frontend will be developed later (maybe).

## Current Features

  Users can create and manage their workout plans.

- Weight Tracking:  
  Users can log their daily weight to monitor progress over time.

- Workout Sessions:  
  Users can start a workout and record weights, reps, and sets (yes with a webapp).

- Trainer Mode:  
  Any user can upgrade their account to become a trainer.
